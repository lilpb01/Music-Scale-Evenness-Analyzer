# Music-Scale-Evenness-Analyzer
This project analyzes the rhythmic evenness of a musical scale recording using audio signal processing techniques with librosa. It detects individual note onsets, computes the time between them (inter-onset intervals), and calculates an evenness score to evaluate timing consistency â€” useful for performers, music educators, and signal analysts.
